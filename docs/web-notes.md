## HTML Introduction

### Parts of an HTML Element

[MDN - Getting Started with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started)

HTML elements are the building blocks of displaying information on a web page. Often referred to as 'tags', many HTML elements will have an open tag and closing tag:

Most html elements, are structured as follows:
Open the tag with `<` and then the tag identifier is inside, and the tag is closed out with `>`. Then you want to close out the tag but adding a `/` in the `>`. So:

```html
<p>Here is the element content</p>
```

#### Types of HTML elements

When working with HTML elements, there is types that require open and closing tags. However, there are elements that are considered to be **self-closing**. These tags do not need to have a second closing tag, some examples include:

| HTML element | Use             |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `<hr />`     | Horizontal Rule |
| `<br />`     | Line Break      |
| `<img />`    | Image           |

### Starting structure of a HTML page

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE lang=en>
  <html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
  </html>
```

### Adding a comment in HTML

[Comments on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Comment#content)

Commenting in HTML (or any language) is helpful for two reasons:

+ Make notes on what the code does both for yourself but also if you are working on a team
+ To help with troubleshooting code that is not working as intended.

#### Comment in HTML

```html
<!-- This is an HTML Comment -->
```
